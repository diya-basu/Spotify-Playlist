**Musical Time Machine:** Spotify playlist generator using Billboard HOT 100 

**Spotify (/ˈspɒtɪfaɪ/; Swedish: [ˈspɔ̂tːɪfaj])** is a proprietary Swedish audio streaming and media services provider founded on 23 April 2006 by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. It is one of the largest music streaming service providers, with over 527 million monthly active users, including 210 million paying subscribers, as of March 2023. Spotify is listed (through a Luxembourg City-domiciled holding company, Spotify Technology S.A on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American depositary receipts.

This project aims to construct a sort of musical Time Machine, utilising the Billboard HOT 100’s and date function. Coded in python and utilising the Beuatiful Soup modules, this program derives data from the Billboard HOT 100 website by utilising a date input from the user, and generates a Spotify playlist on the user’s account with that date as the label name of the playlist.
